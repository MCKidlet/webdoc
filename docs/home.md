# Welcome to the MCpcDOC Project!

## Good websites to use

* [**BobPony**](https://www.bobpony.com/)
* [**BetaWiki**](https://betawiki.net/wiki/Main_Page)
* [**Virtual x86**](https://copy.sh/v86/) (This site allows you to mess with some VMs of classic operating systems and you can make your own right on the website!)

## Bad websites to use

* [**Archive.org**](https://www.archive.org) (This is because Archive.org has lots of viruses and slow download speeds!)
