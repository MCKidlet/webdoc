MCKidlet's guide to virtual Machines
-----

This document will guide you through how to get started in the world of VM's.

Will my computer work?
-----

It depends, obviously a newer computer with better specifications will work better then a computer with lower specs, but let's really dig into it

PC vs Laptop, which is better for emulation?
-----

PC's will give you access to a wider range of specifications, you can use a full size GPU and motherboard instead of a laptops motherboard and integrated graphics. I reccomend an nvidia RTX 2060 and an intel i7 10th gen or equivelant GPU and CPU by another manufacturer.

I use a Laptop though, and I will explain my experience, right now I am using an MSI TITAN GT77 HX 13V which provides me enough power to run a virtual machine with minimal lag; however, if you decide to use your old laptop from 2015, dont expect the best performance, I reccomend for laptops you must at least have an nvidia RTX 2060 and an intel i7 10th gen or equivelant GPU and CPU by another manufacturer.

Is RAM important?
----

Yes, RAM is one of the most important things, next to your CPU, you'll need a decent CPU and lots of RAM to get good performance, obviously a good GPU helps but a CPU and RAM are what really make the experience good or bad. If you have a very limited amount of RAM you can allocate to a virtual machine then it's best you don't use a modern virtual machine since older ones don't require as much power, but if you have lots of RAM to spare then you can experiment with a newer operating system.

Should I allocate all my resources to a VM?
----

No, you should not, it isn't healthy for your host and you may have background tasks that are keeping running, unless you have a server it's best to not allocate all your resources to your virtual machine(s).
