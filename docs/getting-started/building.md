# Build your first VM

Its time to build your first virtual machine, this part is only for Windows and VMware Workstation, reference the [**GUIDE**](/guide/intro.md) for more operating systems.

## Download an ISO file!!

You cant do much without an ISO file, aka a Disk Image File, this file contains the operating system and will allow you to set it up, you can use a website like [**Bobpony**](https://www.bobpony.com/downloads/) to download an iso. For this tutorial I'll be using a windows 10 (22H2) ISO.

!!If you have an Installer Disk (physical disk) then you can skip this part.
## Open VMWare Workstation

Time to open up that dreaded software that youll have to learn to love, youll probably come to a screen that displays a couple options, you'll want to click "Create a New Virtual Machine". After you click thst option youll get two other options, *Typical* and *Custom* install, pick *Typical* for this tutorial. You'll now get three options, *Installer Disk*, *Disk Image*, and *I'll install it later*.

## Installer Disk

This is a physical disk on your computer.

## Disk Image!!

This is an ISO File you've installed.

!!For this tutorial I'll be using an ISO.
## Install Later

Put an ISO or Installer Disk on your VM later.

## Continued - Create VM

After you select the *Disk Image* option, you'll most likely be brought through an auto setup page, if not then follow the instructions shown on screen, now you'll want to name your VM, you can use the preset name or you can use a custom name you think would work nicely.

## Continued - Storage and finalization

You're almost done, now you'll want to select how much storage you think your VM will require, if you selected the proper operating system on the previous step then you should have a good amount of storage for your VM, but i always use 80gb to 120gb to be safe. (It is reccomended you split the virtual disk unless its a small storage amount. Alright now you can click "Finish" to boot into your VM, if everything goes well then you should be loading into your setup.
