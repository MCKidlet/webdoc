# Where should I start?
It's really up to you where you want to start, but if it's your first time in the VM space I really reccomend trying to install windows 10 on a virtual machine, i have a [**guide**](/guide/intro.md) for it right on this document, if you're experienced then you can attempt to experiment with beta operating systems. (currently I am experimenting with beta operating systems on my [**Twitch**](https://www.twitch.tv/mckidlet))

## Learn the basics
You can always dip your toes into the deepend if you want but it's really best if you stick with the basics when youre starting off, there's a few expectations you need to understand before you start working with virtual machines.

*Expecation 1* : You need to be ready to WAIT, things like operating system setup and creating the VM take time and patience better be something you're good with.
?> Patience is a virtue.

*Expectation 2* : Don't think you'll be able to install every OS under the sun, unfortunately, there's some operating systems that plain just do not work.

*Expectation 3* : Don't expect things to work first try, hope is great but you'll quickly want to give up if you expect it to work first try, just find a solution to your problem and try again if it doesn't work the first time, some OS's, specifically betas, have something called a [**timebomb**](https://betawiki.net/wiki/Timebomb) which causes the OS to not work after a certain period of time, this can be fixed within the BIOS of your VM manager (VMware, UTM, Hyper-V, etc...)
