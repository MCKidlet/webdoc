# MCpcDOC Project

## What is This Project?

  This project is intended to make IT feel simpler and easier for the average person.

## Is this project only for Virtual Machines?

  Possibly, it's planned that I'll add more in the future but virtual machine documentation is my current and only focus for this project.

## Can I use this project?

  You can use the source code to create your own documentation website; however, you must use my research and documentation with a citation if you are going to directly put my work in your research. If you're asking if you can copy the entire site and claim it as your own? No, you can't.

## Why is it all on Github?

  It's easy to host on github.
